# **Introduction to the Ceramic Protocol**

> Ceramic's mission is to create a web without silos. This document provides an introduction to the Ceramic protocol. For a more technical overview, see [Ceramic Technical Specification](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/specs).

[**Ceramic**](http://ceramic.network) is a permissionless protocol for creating and accessing mutable, tamper-proof documents that serve as the foundation for a web without silos. Ceramic's infrastructure provides a source of truth for important information that is public, interoperable, verifiable and censorship-resistant. By migrating critical information from isolated servers into the public commons of linked documents with cryptographic consensus, Ceramic enables apps to finally escape information and infrastructure silos and build in a compsable, efficient, and connected way. Ceramic can do for user data, services, and infrastructure what blockchains have done for assets. 

Because participants can create and resolve documents for any type of information without any centralized service, Ceramic unlocks interoperability between *all platforms and services across the web.* It is ideal for storing information that requires guaranteed trust, cross-platform interoperability, and multi-party consumption. This includes registries for decentralized identifiers, access control logs, policies for usage or services, and and other documents that anchor a dynamic, connected and unbundled ecosystem of users, wallets, applications, databases, and services. Ceramic enables: 

- [Interoperable user and application data](#interoperable-data-ecosystems)
- [Portable, self-sovereign identity](#portable-self-sovereign-identity)
- [Open web services without new accounts](#open-web-services)

Ceramic's global ecosystem of interoperable identities, data, and services allows developers to build composable applications with unprecedented interoperability, trust and scale. Ceramic is the foundation for developers to build a more connected, transparent, and user-centric internet.

### Background

Despite the benefits of cloud services, SaaS dev tools, and API businesses, building a fully featured product or service is still way too complex, fragile and limited. Even simple apps require deploying and maintaining a backend, securing and managing user data (more frought than ever), and tying a tangle of APIs and services together. Choices made early often lock you into technology providers long-term, which vendors exploit. And making your value-add interoperate with your users' other products and services is often difficult, unpredictable, hard-to-scale work. This is because infrastructure, information and access control are needlessly replicated and siloed for each application. 

They key to more interoperable, composable applications without the problems of these siloes is a common model for storing key information: a flexible, discoverable, yet privacy-preserving shared backend for information. The solution is a user-centric model for data and identities. By letting users control their data, share (or not) their other services and related information, and bring their identities and metadata across experiences, developers only need to worry about 1 API to scale interoperability and personalization indefinitely: the user. (This scales to any kind of identity - for users, organizations, apps, services, etc.)

The composable web needs a permissionless, identity-centric interoperability protocol to provide applications with all the information they need to easily discover, route to, gain access to, and interact with a user's resources regardless of which wallet users bring, which applications created the data, or where the resources are located. This protocol must: 

1. Permissionlessly register an interoperable identity (DID); 
2. Privately control this identity with multiple private keys;
3. Publicly associate public keys and accounts to this identity;
4. Publicly or privately associate resources to this identity;
5. Set permissions for resources;
6. Perform access control to resources;
7. Interoperably sign and/or encrypt information; and
8. Revoke private keys, public keys, and permissions for resources. 
 
In addition to these base requirements, a protocol aiming to practically unlock interoperability should also allow applications and services to:

9. Publish metadata and definitions;
10. Publish data schemas; and
11. Publish policies and service agreements.

Any solution does not meet these requirements will be too siloed to be interoperable, too rigid to be broadly used, or too isolated to meet the demands of today's businesses. 

## What should be stored on Ceramic?

Ceramic provides a *universal graph of verifiable documents*. Ceramic documents are signed, append-only objects stored in [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs), encoded using [IPLD](https://github.com/ipld/ipld), and anchored in one or more blockchains. Due to its hybrid design relying on IPFS/IPLD and various blockchains, Ceramic's document graph is interoperable, scalable, permissionless, and low cost (variable depending on blochain anchor service).

Documents are a flexible primitive that can be modeled to represent many things. Below you can find some of the common ways that documents are used.  Most of these can be created with the three standard [doctypes](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/specs#document-types) currently supported by Ceramic: [3id](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/specs/blob/master/doctypes/3id.md), [account-link](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/specs/blob/master/doctypes/account-link.md), and [policy](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/specs/blob/master/doctypes/policy.md). If your use case doesn't fit into one of these doctypes, you can add new doctypes to the protocol by submitting an issue on the [Ceramic specs](http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/specs/issues) repository.

### Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

Ceramic DIDs are globally unique identities used to sign documents on the Ceramic network and also interact with arbitrary off-chain services and data. DIDs are abstract, key-agnostic interfaces used to identify participants, interoperably sign and encrypt information, authorize authentication/access control to services, and store mappings to additional resources. Ceramic makes no assumptions about what kind of entity a DID represents, so they can be users, organizations, applications, services, devices, etc. Additionally, Ceramic DIDs can be controlled by one or many private keys, providing flexibility and interoperability across wallets and platforms. 

A DID consists of two core documents:

- **Decentralized Identifier (DID)**: A globally unique way to identify an entity
- **Management Data**: Allows one or many private keys to control a DID

Other resource mappings are stored through additional documents below.

> Ceramic currently supports the 3ID DID method. [Learn more about 3IDs](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/specs/blob/master/doctypes/3id.md) or see an [example](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/specs/blob/master/doctypes/3id.md#example).

### Metadata

Ceramic DIDs will likely want to express additional metadata or context about themselves. Depending on the type of entity that a DID represents this may vary.

- **Public Profiles**: Provide context about a DID
  - Basic: General profile metadata such as name, image, logo, etc.
  - Descriptors: More complete descriptions for services, apps, etc.
- **Identity Links**: Allow others to verify that two identities are owned by the same DID
  - Account Links: Public mappings to public keys, smart contracts, other DIDs, etc.
  - Social Links: Public mappings to twitter, github, etc.
  - DNS Links: Public mappings to domain names
- **Resource Links**: Allow others to verify that a resource is owned by the DID
  - Data Links: Mappings to various data sources such as databases, verififiable claims, registries, etc.
  - Service Links: Mappings to services and APIs

### Policies

Ceramic DIDs will also likely want to define explicit policies that govern various things about their identity or resources that help others others interoperate with them.

- **Schema Policies**: Define schemas for data
- **Collection Policies**: Define an app's data model (database types plus schema policies)
- **Service Policies**: ToS and requirements for using a resource, may include service endpoint and payment info
- **Privacy Policies**: User-defined access control permissions for their resources

### Agreements

Ceramic DIDs may want to form explicit agreements between one another. An example of this would be a **service agreement**, which is a multi-party agreement between a provider and purchaser of a service (i.e. data hosting).

### Claims

Ceramic DIDs may want to create statements about other DIDs. To achieve this they can create a **verifiable claim**, which is a flexible standard for creating signed statements or data. If the verifiable claim is accepted by the recipient, is included in the recipient's metadata above.

## Use Cases

Although Ceramic documents can act as standalone objects, most production systems and applications will combine multiple documents and participants to enable extremely powerful use cases that demonstrate the potential of identity-centric interoperability and the unbundling of identities and resources from networks and applications.

### Portable, Self-Sovereign Identity

Self-sovereign identity (SSI) describes a system where participants can permissionlessly create and control their digital identity using one or more private keys. Technically, SSI could be enabled by any decentralized asymmetric cryptography system where public keys (identities) are controlled by private keys (passwords) such as bitcoin or ethereum. However, this type of system is still limited to the network on which these identities are registered, as well as the single private key account. These two constraints function as silos that prevent this identity from being used interoperably in additional contexts.

For identities to be truly flexible and portable across platforms and keys, which makes them more useful in practice, we need an additional identity abstraction that lives at a layer above blockchain accounts. This is the value of DIDs. On Ceramic, DIDs function as the global public identity and they can be controlled by any number of private keys from any blockchain or cryptographic system. DIDs provide a single interface that owners can use to identify themselves, interoperably sign messages, encrypt data, and auhorize/access control to off-chain services that is agnostic to which blockchain a user is on. DIDs are the antidote to private key and network lock-in.

Additionally, SSI is often meant to include much more than direct control of an identifier. Most times, this identifier needs more context so others can interact with it, such as profile details. Ceramic provides additional document types that allow owners to add metadata and other additional information to their SSI.

DIDs follow a standard specification for base functionality, and there may be many DID providers. Ceramic supports DIDs as doctypes. Currently Ceramic supports the 3ID DID method, but additional ones may be defined on the network.

### Interoperable Data Ecosystems

Along with identity portability, it is often desirable to have data portability across applications. This requires a few core functionalities. First, we need to have a universal way to identify a user across platforms, so that we can know which data is theirs. This is handled by SSI/DIDs (see above). Second, we need to know where this data lives. Third, we need to be able to access this data. Last, we need to know the schema of the data so we can consume it in our application without manual processing.

By storing mappings to data resources in a user's DID, Ceramic provides an identity-centric way for data consumers to efficiently discover where information lives, whether on a specific server or a public network. Also by allowing Ceramic DIDs to define access control policies for their data resources, Ceramic provides an identity-centric way for users to provide consumers access to their information regardless of where it lives. Instead of access control happening on the server, it happens directly on the user. And last, Ceramic allows applications to define schemas for their data so that consumers can know a priori the shape of the data that will be returned, even if it is encrypted.

Together these capabilities allow users to frictionolessly control and share their data across various applications.

### Open Web Services

The last piece of the interoperability puzzle is providing more open access to web services. This allows service providers (i.e. data hosting, indexing, anchoring, payments, or other arbitrary web/API services) to service requests from *all* consumers regardless of whether or not they have an account with the service provider. This allows service providers to remove the requirement of consumers creating an account and using an API key to access their service. As a result, services are no longer accessed using an API key from an application's backend, but rather are accessed by meeting certain pre-defined conditions, potentially along with user consent. This allows service providers to grow their customer base on a per-use basis and remove all friction from accessing their services. 

For example, this is required in the case of hosting user data that needs to be accessed by many different parties, most of whom don't have an account with the service. Using Ceramic, the data hosting service can define their service and create a service policy that includes the requirements a consumer must meet in order to access their service. When a user (or application) chooses to use this service to host their data in a database that is access controlled by a Ceramic DID, the user (or app) then adds this resource to their DID. When other consumers want to request this information they need to request access permissions from the user, and once approved, then fulfill the requirments of the hosting service (such as payments or other) before the data will be returned.

Although this depicts an example of a data hosting service, Ceramic service policies can be used for almost any type of service.

### Examples
To highlight what's possible, let's dive into how [3Box](http://github.com/3box/3box) relies on Ceramic to enable an interoperable, user-controlled data management system. 3Box is a framework that allows developers to store user and application data on a network of open data hosting services access controlled by users instead of on siloed application servers. Users are always in control of their data and can choose to permission it out to other applications, making it shareable across platforms and applications. To achieve this 3Box relies on [self-sovereign identity](#portable-self-sovereign-identity), [interoperable data](#interoperable-data-ecosystems), and [open web services](#open-web-services). 

For self-sovereign identity and to enable user-managed access control, 3Box uses Ceramic's 3ID DID method which allows users to control their identity, information, and services using all of their existing private wallet keys. To enable interoperable data and shared access web services, 3Box relies on the following set of policy documents which are created by the various participants including applications, services, and users:

| Policy | Description | Use Case |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------- |
| [Collection Policy]() | Describes a collection of databases with specific schemas | Allows applications to define their databases and data models so others can easily consume the data |
| [Service Policy]() | Describes simple functions that take an input and produce an output. In this case, it's used for database hosting | Allows service providers to define their service or API and the requirements to access it |
| [Privacy Policy]() | Describes user-managed access control rights to databases in the Collection Policy  | Allows users to set permissions and control their privacy while sharing data across apps |

In practice, this collection of functionalities allows App A to store data for User B on a hosting service in databases that are access controlled by 3IDs. User B can now go to App C and give them permission to access their data from App A. To receive the data from the hosting service, App C must meet the requirements defined by the hosting service's service policy which may include payment information.

## Ceramic Ecosystem

By now you understand that Ceramic enables the emergence of a diverse, interoperable ecosystem of user-controlled wallets, data stores, and infrastructure services that allow developers to build lightweight, composable, collaborative applications. Here's how you can participate.

### Wallets and Authentication Systems

**Integrate Platform-Agnostic, Self-Sovereign Identity**: Give your users a Ceramic 3ID, which is an abstraction from individual key pair and contract accounts that eliminates private key lock-in. DIDs are used for interoperable data signing, encryption, and service authorization with all the wallet keys your users already have.

### Databases

**Integrate a Unified, User-Mangaged Access Control System**: Make your database's access control system compatible with Ceramic 3IDs so users can manage their information stored across all databases with a single identity and allow different applications to access their information. Ceramic will first support IPFS-based peer-to-peer databases [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db) and [Textile](https://github.com/textileio).

### Services

**Offer Open, Shared Access Services**: Offer Ceramic-compatible services and list your infrastructure on the Ceramic network to allow others to interact with your service even if they're not your direct customers.

### Applications

**Build Composable, User-Centric Applications**: Build your app using Ceramic's ecosystem of connected, interoperable services. Store your user and application data in Ceramic-enabled databases with infrastructure providers that support Ceramic service agreements. Also use Ceramic to discover available data sources to populate your application.
